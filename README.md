This project remade a base version of Twitter, the social media site using React. The simulated tweets are power by a mock API in project folder src filename called index.jsx

This program allows data to flow through components and get presented in the UI, there is also CSS styling used to get the sleek Twitter look

Run $npm install $ npm run start see Webpack runs the $ webpack-dev server command, which both compile our project, and launches our development server. Now you can change App.jsx as wanted and see the updates made live.

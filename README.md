![Ticketing](img/remake_twitter2.png?raw=true "remake-twitter")

This project remade a base version of Twitter, the social media site using React. The simulated tweets are powered by a mock API in the project folder 'src' filename called index.jsx

This program allows data to flow through components and get presented in the UI, there is also CSS styling used to get the sleek Twitter look. There is also a state used to color the hearts under the  tweet just click the heart, see the red heart under the 50 Cent tweet in the screenshot below.

In terminal Run the 2 commands below:

$ npm install

$ npm run start

What is happening is Webpack runs the $ webpack-dev server command, which both compile our project, and launches our development server. Now you can change App.jsx as wanted and see the updates made live.
